# Home Construction XR App

## Overview

The **Home Construction XR App** is an innovative application designed to transform the home design process by providing an immersive and interactive experience using XR (Extended Reality) technology. It empowers users to design, customize, and visualize their dream homes in a virtual environment, bridging the gap between conceptual design and practical implementation.

## Problem Statement

Home designing is a complex and iterative process that often fails to provide an immersive or true-to-scale experience for stakeholders. Common challenges include:

- Lack of interactive tools to replace traditional design methods.
- Difficulty visualizing spatial arrangements and configurations.
- Miscommunication between designers, homeowners, and developers.
- Absence of intuitive and engaging components for design.

## Project Objectives

The app aims to:

- Provide an **immersive platform** for home designing using XR technology.
- Enable users to **place, modify, and customize design components** interactively.
- Offer a **virtual walkthrough experience** for better visualization and informed decision-making.
- Address specific needs of homeowners, architects, and real estate developers.

## Features

1. **Instruction Scene**: An introduction to app navigation with detailed developer information.
2. **Design Environment**: A city-themed construction platform for building homes from scratch.
3. **Navigation**: 
   - Use thumbsticks for teleportation and rotation.
   - Support for real-world walking within the virtual space.
4. **Preferences Menu**: Customization options for environment settings, controller assignments, and lighting.
5. **Hand UI Menu**:
   - Prefab selection for objects like walls, roofs, and floors.
   - Color and texture customization for interior and exterior surfaces.
   - Snapshot functionality for saving designs.
   - Reset button for starting over.
6. **Object Interactions**:
   - Grab, duplicate, delete, and rotate objects with intuitive controller interactions.
   - Apply textures and colors to specific surfaces.
   - Snapping functionality for precise alignment.
7. **Snapshot Feature**:
   - Save designs with timestamped filenames in platform-specific directories.

## Target Audience

The app caters to diverse users across the residential construction ecosystem:

- **Homeowners**: Customize and visualize homes as per their preferences.
- **Architects and Designers**: Present ideas effectively and collaborate with clients.
- **Construction Professionals**: Pre-sell properties and facilitate team collaboration.
